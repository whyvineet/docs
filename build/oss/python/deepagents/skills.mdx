Skills are reusable agent capabilities that provide specialized workflows and domain knowledge.

You can use [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) to provide your deep agent with new capabilities and expertise.

Deep agent skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## What are skills

Skills are a directory of folders, where each folder has one or more files that contain context the agent can use:

- A `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata about the skill
- Additional scripts (optional)
- Additional reference info, such as docs (optional)
- Additional assets, such as templates and other resources (optional)

<Note>
    Any additional assets (scripts, docs, templates, or other resources) must be referenced in the `SKILL.md` file with information on what the file contains and how to use it so the agent can decide when to use them.
</Note>

## How skills work

When you create a deep agent, you can pass in a list of directories containing skills. As the agent starts, it reads through the frontmatter of each `SKILL.md` file.

When the agent receives a prompt, the agent checks if it can use any skills while fulfilling the prompt. If it finds a matching prompt, it then reviews the rest of the skill files. This pattern of only reviewing the skill information when needed is called *progressive disclosure*.

## Example

You might have a skills folder that contains a skill to use a docs site in a certain way, as well as another skill to search the arXiv preprint repository of research papers:

```plaintext
    skills/
    ├── langgraph-docs
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── arxiv_search
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── arxiv_search.py # code for searching arXiv
```




The `SKILL.md` file always follows the same pattern, starting with metadata in the frontmatter and followed by the instructions for the skill.

The following example shows a skill that gives instructions on how to provide relevant langgraph docs when prompted:

```md
---
name: langgraph-docs
description: Use this skill for requests related to LangGraph in order to fetch relevant documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
---

# langgraph-docs

## Overview

This skill explains how to access LangGraph Python documentation to help answer questions and guide implementation.

## Instructions

### 1. Fetch the Documentation Index

Use the fetch_url tool to read the following URL:
https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt

This provides a structured list of all available documentation with descriptions.

### 2. Select Relevant Documentation

Based on the question, identify 2-4 most relevant documentation URLs from the index. Prioritize:

- Specific how-to guides for implementation questions
- Core concept pages for understanding questions
- Tutorials for end-to-end examples
- Reference docs for API details

### 3. Fetch Selected Documentation

Use the fetch_url tool to read the selected documentation URLs.

### 4. Provide Accurate Guidance

After reading the documentation, complete the user's request.
```

<Warning>
    **Important**

    Refer to the full [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for information on constraints and best practices when authoring skill files. Notably:

    * The `description` field is truncated to 1024 characters if it exceeds that length.
    * In Deep Agents, `SKILL.md` files must be under 10 MB. Files exceeding this limit are skipped during skill loading.
</Warning>

### Full example

The following example shows a `SKILL.md` file using all available frontmatter fields:

```md expandable
---
name: langgraph-docs
description: Use this skill for requests related to LangGraph in order to fetch relevant documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires internet access for fetching documentation URLs

## Usage

Pass the skills directory when creating your deep agent:

<SkillsUsageTabsPy />

<ParamField body="skills" type="list[str]" optional>
    List of skill source paths.

    Paths must be specified using forward slashes and are relative to the backend's root.

    - When using `StateBackend` (default), provide skill files with `invoke(files={...})`. Use `create_file_data()` from `deepagents.backends.utils` to format file contents; raw strings are not supported.
    - With `FilesystemBackend`, skills are loaded from disk relative to the backend's `root_dir`.

    Later sources override earlier ones for skills with the same name (last one wins).
</ParamField>





## Source precedence

When multiple skill sources contain a skill with the same name, the skill from the source listed later in the `skills` array takes precedence (last one wins). This lets you layer skills from different origins.

```python
# If both sources contain a skill named "web-search",
# the one from "/skills/project/" wins (loaded last).
agent = create_deep_agent(
    skills=["/skills/user/", "/skills/project/"],
    ...
)
```




{/* When using the [Deep Agents CLI](/oss/python/deepagents/data-locations), the precedence order from lowest to highest is:

1. `~/.deepagents/{agent}/skills/` — User-level, agent-specific
2. `~/.agents/skills/` — User-level, tool-agnostic
3. `.deepagents/skills/` — Project-level, agent-specific
4. `.agents/skills/` — Project-level, tool-agnostic (highest priority)

For more details on file locations and precedence, see [App data](/oss/python/deepagents/data-locations). */}

## What the agent sees

When skills are configured, a "Skills System" section is injected into the agent's system prompt. The agent uses this information to follow a three-step process:

1. **Match** — When a user prompt arrives, the agent checks whether any skill's description matches the task.
2. **Read** — If a skill applies, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` file using the path shown in its skills list.
3. **Execute** — The agent follows the skill's instructions and accesses any supporting files (scripts, templates, reference docs) as needed.

<Tip>
    Write clear, specific descriptions in your `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The agent decides whether to use a skill based on the description alone — detailed descriptions lead to better skill matching.
</Tip>

## Skills vs. memory

Skills and [memory](/oss/python/deepagents/customization#memory) (`AGENTS.md` files) serve different purposes:

| | Skills | Memory |
|---|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | On-demand capabilities discovered through progressive disclosure | Persistent context always loaded at startup |
| **Loading** | Read only when the agent determines relevance | Always injected into system prompt |
| **Format** | `SKILL.md` in named directories | `AGENTS.md` files |
| **Layering** | User → project (last wins) | User → project (combined) |
| **Use when** | Instructions are task-specific and potentially large | Context is always relevant (project conventions, preferences) |

## When to use skills and tools

These are a few general guidelines for using tools and skills:

- Use skills when there is a lot of context to reduce the number of tokens in the system prompt.
- Use skills to bundle capabilities together into larger actions and provide additional context beyond single tool descriptions.
- Use tools if the agent does not have access to the file system.
