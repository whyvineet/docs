> [DocArray](https://docarray.jina.ai/) is a library for nested, unstructured, multimodal data in transit,
> including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc. It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process,
> embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer multimodal data with a Pythonic API.


## Installation and setup

We need to install `docarray` python package.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install docarray
```

```bash uv
uv add docarray
```
</CodeGroup>

## Vector store

LangChain provides an access to the `In-memory` and `HNSW` vector stores from the `DocArray` library.

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/docarray_hnsw).

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import DocArrayHnswSearch
```
See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/docarray_in_memory).

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores DocArrayInMemorySearch
```

## Retriever

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers/docarray_retriever).

```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import DocArrayRetriever
```
