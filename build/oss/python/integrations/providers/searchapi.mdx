description: "Integrate with SearchAPI using LangChain Python."
---

This page covers how to use the [SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/) Google Search API within LangChain. SearchApi is a real-time SERP API for easy SERP scraping.

## Setup

- Go to [https://www.searchapi.io/](https://www.searchapi.io/) to sign up for a free account
- Get the api key and set it as an environment variable (`SEARCHAPI_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### Utility

There is a SearchApiAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SearchApiAPIWrapper
```

You can use it as part of an agent with search tools:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SearchApiAPIWrapper
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_agent, Tool

import os

os.environ["SEARCHAPI_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
search = SearchApiAPIWrapper()

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Intermediate Answer",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to ask with search",
    )
]

agent = create_agent(
    model=llm,
    tools=tools,
)

agent.invoke("Who lived longer: Plato, Socrates, or Aristotle?")
```

#### Output

```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 Yes.
Follow up: How old was Plato when he died?
Intermediate answer: eighty
Follow up: How old was Socrates when he died?
Intermediate answer: | Socrates |
| -------- |
| Born | c. 470 BC Deme Alopece, Athens |
| Died | 399 BC (aged approximately 71) Athens |
| Cause of death | Execution by forced suicide by poisoning |
| Spouse(s) | Xanthippe, Myrto |

Follow up: How old was Aristotle when he died?
Intermediate answer: 62 years
So the final answer is: Plato

> Finished chain.
'Plato'
```

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["searchapi"])
```

For more information on tools, see [this page](/oss/python/integrations/tools).
