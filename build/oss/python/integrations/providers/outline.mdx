> [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/) is an open-source collaborative knowledge base platform designed for team information sharing.

## Setup

You first need to [create an api key](https://www.getoutline.com/developers#section/Authentication) for your Outline instance. Then you need to set the following environment variables:

```python
import os

os.environ["OUTLINE_API_KEY"] = "xxx"
os.environ["OUTLINE_INSTANCE_URL"] = "https://app.getoutline.com"
```

## Retriever

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers/outline).

```python
from langchain_classic.retrievers import OutlineRetriever
```
