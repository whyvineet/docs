>[Cube](https://cube.dev/) is the Semantic Layer for building data apps. It helps

> organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

## Installation and setup

We have to get the API key and the URL of the Cube instance. See
[these instructions](https://cube.dev/docs/product/apis-integrations/rest-api#configuration-base-path).


## Document loader
