[Stardog](https://www.stardog.com) is an enterprise knowledge graph platform that enables organizations to unify, query, and analyze their data.

Give agents a tool to:

- Ask natural language questions and get hallucination-free answers from your enterprise knowledge graph database
- Generate SPARQL queries from natural language
- Query and analyze structured data using semantic reasoning
- Access enterprise data through a conversational interface

### How it works
Stardog provides knowledge graph infrastructure that combines data integration with natural language processing:

1. Give your agent access to enterprise knowledge graphs
2. Query data using natural language through Voicebox
3. Get accurate, grounded answers backed by your data

## Installation and setup

Check out the [tool documentation](/oss/python/integrations/tools/stardog) to see how to set up and use the available tools.
