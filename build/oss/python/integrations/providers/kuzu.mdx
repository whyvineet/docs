> [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com/) is an embeddable, scalable, extremely fast graph database.
> It is permissively licensed with an MIT license, and you can see its source code [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu).

> Key characteristics of Kùzu:
>- Performance and scalability: Implements modern, state-of-the-art join algorithms for graphs.
>- Usability: Very easy to set up and get started with, as there are no servers (embedded architecture).
>- Interoperability: Can conveniently scan and copy data from external columnar formats, CSV, JSON and relational databases.
>- Structured property graph model: Implements the property graph model, with added structure.
>- Cypher support: Allows convenient querying of the graph in Cypher, a declarative query language.

> Get started with Kùzu by visiting their [documentation](https://docs.kuzudb.com/).
