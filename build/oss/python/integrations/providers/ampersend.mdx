[Ampersend](https://ampersend.ai) enables LangChain agents to pay for and use remote AI agent services.

Give agents tools to:

- Pay for remote agent services automatically
- Interact with remote A2A agents

### How it works

Ampersend provides transparent payment handling via the x402 protocol:

1. Connect your agent to a wallet with spend controls
2. Call remote agents via the A2A protocol
3. Payments are handled automatically when required

## Installation and setup

Check out the [tool documentation](/oss/python/integrations/tools/ampersend) to see how to set up and install Ampersend.
