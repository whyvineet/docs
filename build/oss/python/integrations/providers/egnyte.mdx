[Egnyte](https://www.egnyte.com) is a cloud-based content collaboration and file sharing platform that enables organizations to securely store, share, and govern their files. Egnyte combines the power of cloud content management with advanced security, compliance, and AI-powered search capabilities.

This package provides a LangChain integration for Egnyte's hybrid search API, which combines semantic and keyword search to help you find and retrieve documents from your Egnyte instance.

## Installation and setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U egnyte-langchain-connector
```

```bash uv
uv add egnyte-langchain-connector
```
</CodeGroup>

# egnyte-langchain-connector

This package contains the LangChain integration with Egnyte. For more information about Egnyte, check out the [Egnyte developer documentation](https://developers.egnyte.com/).

## Prerequisites

In order to integrate with Egnyte, you need:

* An Egnyte account — If you are not a current Egnyte customer or want to test outside of your production Egnyte instance, you can use a [free developer account](https://developers.egnyte.com/member/register).
* An Egnyte app — This is configured in the [developer console](https://developers.egnyte.com/), and must have the appropriate scopes enabled.
* The app must be enabled by the administrator.

## Authentication

The `egnyte-langchain-connector` package uses Bearer token authentication with Egnyte user tokens.

### Generating a user token

To generate an Egnyte user token for authentication:

1. **Register for a Developer Account**
   - Visit [https://developers.egnyte.com/member/register](https://developers.egnyte.com/member/register)
   - Create your free developer account

2. **Generate User Token**
   - Use your API key to generate a user token following the [Public API Authentication guide](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication)
   - **Important**: Use the scope `Egnyte.ai` when generating the token to ensure proper access to AI-powered search features

### Using the token

You can pass the token directly to the retriever:

```python
import getpass

egnyte_user_token = getpass.getpass("Enter your Egnyte User Token: ")
domain = "company.egnyte.com"  # Your Egnyte domain (without https://)
```

Or use environment variables:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

egnyte_user_token = os.getenv("EGNYTE_USER_TOKEN")
domain = os.getenv("EGNYTE_DOMAIN")
```

## Retrievers

### EgnyteRetriever

[See usage example](/oss/python/python/integrations/retrievers/egnyte)

```python
from langchain_egnyte import EgnyteRetriever

retriever = EgnyteRetriever(domain="company.egnyte.com")
```

## Utilities

### EgnyteSearchOptions

Configure advanced search parameters:

```python
from langchain_egnyte import EgnyteSearchOptions

search_options = EgnyteSearchOptions(
    limit=50,
    folderPath="/policies",
    excludeFolderPaths=["/temp", "/archive"],
    createdAfter=1640995200000,  # Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    createdBefore=1672531200000
)
```
