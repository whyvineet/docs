[AskNews](https://asknews.app/) enhances language models with up-to-date global or historical news
by processing and indexing over 300,000 articles daily, providing prompt-optimized responses
through a low-latency endpoint, and ensuring transparency and diversity in its news coverage.

the [AskNews console](https://my.asknews.app/).
