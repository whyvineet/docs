This page covers how to use Teradata Vector Store within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Teradata wrappers.

## Installation
- Install the Python package with `pip install langchain-teradata`

## Setup
The first step is to create a connection to your Teradata Vantage system.

    You'll need your Teradata credentials including hostname, username, password, and optionally API tokens for cloud deployments. For detailed setup instructions, see the [Teradata Vector Store User Guide](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Teradata-Vector-Store-User-Guide/Introduction-to-the-Enterprise-Vector-Store-User-Guide)
and [ Getting started with Vantage Cloud Lake](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Lake-Getting-Started-with-VantageCloud-Lake/)

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Teradata Vector database, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for similarity search or rag pipelines

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_teradata import TeradataVectorStore
```

### Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Teradata VectorStore, refer to [langchain-teradata User Guide](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Teradata-Package-for-LangChain-User-Guide) and [langchain-teradata workflows](https://github.com/Teradata/langchain-teradata)
