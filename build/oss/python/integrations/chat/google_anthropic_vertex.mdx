title: "ChatAnthropicVertex integration"
description: Get started using Anthropic [chat models](/oss/python/langchain/models) via Vertex AI in LangChain.
---

> [Anthropic Claude 3](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) models on Vertex AI offer fully managed and serverless models as APIs. To use a Claude model on Vertex AI, send a request directly to the Vertex AI API endpoint. Because Anthropic Claude 3 models use a managed API, there's no need to provision or manage infrastructure.

NOTE : Anthropic Models on Vertex are implemented as Chat Model through class `ChatAnthropicVertex`

```python
!pip install -U langchain-google-vertexai anthropic[vertex]
```

```python
from langchain.messages import (
    AIMessage,
    AIMessageChunk,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage,
)
from langchain_core.outputs import LLMResult
from langchain_google_vertexai.model_garden import ChatAnthropicVertex
```

NOTE : Specify the correct [Claude 3 Model Versions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude#claude-opus)

We don't recommend using the Anthropic Claude 3 model versions that don't include a suffix that starts with an @ symbol (claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, or claude-3-haiku).

```python
# TODO : Replace below with your project id and region
project = "<project_id>"
location = "<region>"

# Initialise the Model
model = ChatAnthropicVertex(
    model_name="claude-3-haiku@20240307",
    project=project,
    location=location,
)
```

```python
# prepare input data for the model
raw_context = (
    "My name is Peter. You are my personal assistant. My favorite movies "
    "are Lord of the Rings and Hobbit."
)
question = (
    "Hello, could you recommend a good movie for me to watch this evening, please?"
)
context = SystemMessage(content=raw_context)
message = HumanMessage(content=question)
```

```python
# Invoke the model
response = model.invoke([context, message])
print(response.content)
```

```text
Since your favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, I would recommend checking out some other epic fantasy films that have a similar feel:

1. The Chronicles of Narnia series - These films are based on the beloved fantasy novels by C.S. Lewis and have a great blend of adventure, magic, and memorable characters.

2. Stardust - This 2007 fantasy film, based on the Neil Gaiman novel, has an excellent cast and a charming, whimsical tone.

3. The Golden Compass - The first film adaptation of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series, with stunning visuals and a compelling story.

4. Pan's Labyrinth - Guillermo del Toro's dark, fairy tale-inspired masterpiece set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.

5. The Princess Bride - A classic fantasy adventure film with humor, romance, and unforgettable characters.

Let me know if any of those appeal to you or if you'd like me to suggest something else! I'm happy to provide more personalized recommendations.
```

```python
# You can choose to initialize/ override the model name on Invoke method as well
response = model.invoke([context, message], model_name="claude-3-sonnet@20240229")
print(response.content)
```

```text
Sure, I'd be happy to recommend a movie for you! Since you mentioned that The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are among your favorite movies, I'll suggest some other epic fantasy/adventure films you might enjoy:

1. The Princess Bride (1987) - A classic fairy tale with adventure, romance, and a lot of wit and humor. It has an all-star cast and very quotable lines.

2. Willow (1988) - A fun fantasy film produced by George Lucas with fairies, dwarves, and brownies going on an epic quest. Has a similar tone to the Lord of the Rings movies.

3. Stardust (2007) - An underrated fantasy adventure based on the Neil Gaiman novel about a young man entering a magical kingdom to retrieve a fallen star. Great cast and visuals.

4. The Chronicles of Narnia series - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best known, but the other Narnia films are also very well done fantasy epics.

5. The Golden Compass (2007) - First installment of the His Dark Materials trilogy, set in a parallel universe with armored polar bears and truth-seeking devices.

Let me know if you'd like any other suggestions or have a particular style of movie in mind! I aimed for entertaining fantasy/adventure flicks similar to Lord of the Rings.
```

```python
# Use streaming responses
sync_response = model.stream([context, message], model_name="claude-3-haiku@20240307")
for chunk in sync_response:
    print(chunk.content)
```
