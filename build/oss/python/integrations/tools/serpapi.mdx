This notebook goes over how to use the [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) component to search the web.

Sign up for a SerpApi account [here](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up) to get 250 free searches per month. After signing up, you can find your API key on the [dashboard](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key).

Then set the environment variable `.env` file `SERPAPI_API_KEY` to your API key.

```python
import os
os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = SERPAPI_API_KEY
```

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
```

```python
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
```

```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```

```text
'Barack Hussein Obama II'
```

## Custom parameters

You can also customize the SerpAPI wrapper with arbitrary parameters. For example, in the below example we will use `bing` instead of `google`.

```python
params = {
    "engine": "bing",
    "gl": "us",
    "hl": "en",
}
search = SerpAPIWrapper(params=params)
```

```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```

```text
