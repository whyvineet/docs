>[Stardog](https://www.stardog.com) is an enterprise knowledge graph platform that enables organizations to unify, query, and analyze their data.  
> This integration package provides langchain tools and runnables for interacting with Stardog Voicebox, which is a natural language answering agent providing hallucination-free insights from your enterprise data.

## Overview

The Stardog LangChain integration package provides the following tools for working with Stardog Voicebox:
- `VoiceboxAskTool` - Ask questions and get natural language answers
- `VoiceboxGenerateQueryTool` - Generate SPARQL queries from natural language
- `VoiceboxSettingsTool` - Retrieve Voicebox application settings

All tools support both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes, making them suitable for various application architectures.

For complete details, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-langchain).

## Setup

### Installation

```bash
pip install langchain-stardog
```

### Prerequisites

- A [Stardog Cloud](https://cloud.stardog.com) account
- A Voicebox application configured with your data
- A Voicebox API token

### Getting your API token

1. Log in to [Stardog Cloud](https://cloud.stardog.com)
2. Click on your profile icon and select **Manage API Keys**.
3. Create a new application and generate a secret.
4. Copy the API token and keep it secure.
5. For more details, see Stardog Voicebox API access.

### Credentials

Set your API token as an environment variable:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("SD_VOICEBOX_API_TOKEN"):
    os.environ["SD_VOICEBOX_API_TOKEN"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Voicebox API token: ")
```

Optional environment variables:

```python
os.environ["SD_VOICEBOX_CLIENT_ID"] = "my-app"  # Client identifier (default: VBX-LANGCHAIN)
os.environ["SD_CLOUD_ENDPOINT"] = "https://cloud.stardog.com/api"  # Custom endpoint (optional)
```

## Instantiation and examples

### VoiceboxAskTool

Ask natural language questions relevant to the knowledge graph configured with your API token, and receive hallucination-free answers.

```python
from langchain_stardog.voicebox import VoiceboxAskTool

# Tools automatically load credentials from environment variables
ask_tool = VoiceboxAskTool()

# Ask a question
result = ask_tool.invoke({"question": "What are all flights from San Francisco to New York?"})
print(result)
# Returns: Natural language answer
```

### VoiceboxSettingsTool

Retrieve Voicebox application configuration and metadata.

```python
from langchain_stardog.voicebox import VoiceboxSettingsTool

settings_tool = VoiceboxSettingsTool()

# Get application settings
settings = settings_tool.invoke({})
print(settings)
# Returns: Configuration details like data sources, schema info, and capabilities
```

### VoiceboxGenerateQueryTool

Generate SPARQL queries for the natural language question without executing them.

```python
from langchain_stardog.voicebox import VoiceboxGenerateQueryTool

query_tool = VoiceboxGenerateQueryTool()

# Generate a SPARQL query
query = query_tool.invoke({"question": "Which flights are delayed by more than 30 minutes?"})
print(query)
# Returns: Generated SPARQL query without executing it
```

Refer to the [Examples](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-langchain?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) section for different ways to use these tools and runnables.
