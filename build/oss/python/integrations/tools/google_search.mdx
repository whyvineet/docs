This notebook goes over how to use the google search component.

First, you need to set up the proper API keys and environment variables. To set it up, create the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the Google Cloud credential console ([console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)) and a GOOGLE_CSE_ID using the Programmable Search Engine ([programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create)). Next, it is good to follow the instructions found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search).

Then we will need to set some environment variables.

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-google-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["GOOGLE_CSE_ID"] = ""
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain_google_community import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()


@tool
def google_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search Google for recent results."""
    return search.run(query)
```

```python
google_search.invoke("Obama's first name?")
```

```text

```

## Number of results

You can use the `k` parameter to set the number of results

```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper(k=1)


@tool
def im_feeling_lucky(query: str) -> str:
    """Search Google and return the first result."""
    return search.run(query)
```

```python
im_feeling_lucky.invoke("python")
```

```text
'The official home of the Python Programming Language.'
```

'The official home of the Python Programming Language.'

## Metadata results

Run query through GoogleSearch and return snippet, title, and link metadata.

- Snippet: The description of the result.
- Title: The title of the result.
- Link: The link to the result.

```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()


@tool
def google_search_snippets(query: str) -> str:
    """Search Google for recent results."""
    return search.results(query, 5)
```

```python

```
