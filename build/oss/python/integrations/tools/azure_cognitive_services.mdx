title: "Azure cognitive services toolkit integration"
description: "Integrate with the Azure cognitive services toolkit using LangChain Python."
---

This toolkit lets you interact with **Azure Cognitive Services APIs** to enable multimodal capabilities inside LangChain.

Currently, the toolkit includes:

- **AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool** — extract captions, objects, tags, and text from images
- **AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool** — extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents
- **AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool** — transcribe speech to text
- **AzureCogsText2SpeechTool** — synthesize text to speech
- **AzureCogsTextAnalyticsHealthTool** — extract healthcare entities

> ⚠️ The image analysis tool is not available on macOS because `azure-ai-vision` currently supports Windows/Linux only.

## Installation

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
pip install -qU azure-ai-formrecognizer
pip install -qU azure-cognitiveservices-speech
pip install -qU azure-ai-textanalytics

# Windows / Linux only
pip install -qU azure-ai-vision
```

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_REGION"] = ""
```
```python
## Create the toolkit
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()
toolkit.get_tools()
```

```python
['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']

## Use within an Agent
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

agent = create_agent(
    model=llm,
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
)
```
```python
agent.invoke(
    "What can I make with these ingredients? "
    "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
