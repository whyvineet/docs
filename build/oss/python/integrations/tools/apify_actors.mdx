>[Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) are cloud programs designed for a wide range of web scraping, crawling, and data extraction tasks. These actors facilitate automated data gathering from the web, enabling users to extract, process, and store information efficiently. Actors can be used to perform tasks like scraping e-commerce sites for product details, monitoring price changes, or gathering search engine results. They integrate seamlessly with [Apify Datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset), allowing the structured data collected by actors to be stored, managed, and exported in formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel for further analysis or use.

## Overview

This notebook walks you through using [Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) with LangChain to automate web scraping and data extraction. The `langchain-apify` package integrates Apify's cloud-based tools with LangChain agents, enabling efficient data collection and processing for AI applications.

### Integration details

### Tool features

|:----------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
| ❌ | ✅ | Actor output (varies by Actor) | Pay-per-use, [free tier available](https://apify.com/pricing) |

## Setup

This integration lives in the [langchain-apify](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-apify/) package. The package can be installed using pip.

```python
pip install langchain-apify
```

### Prerequisites

- **Apify account**: Register your free [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/sign-up).
- **Apify API token**: Learn how to get your API token in the [Apify documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api).

```python
import os

os.environ["APIFY_TOKEN"] = "your-apify-token"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"
```

### Pricing

Apify uses pay-per-use pricing with a free tier available.
Pricing varies by Actor – some Actors are free (you only pay for platform usage), while others charge per result or event.

## Instantiation

Here we instantiate the `ApifyActorsTool` to be able to call [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser) Apify Actor. This Actor provides web browsing functionality for AI and LLM applications, similar to the web browsing feature in ChatGPT. Any Actor from the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) can be used in this way.

```python
from langchain_apify import ApifyActorsTool

tool = ApifyActorsTool("apify/rag-web-browser")
```

## Invocation

The `ApifyActorsTool` takes a single argument, which is `run_input` - a dictionary that is passed as a run input to the Actor. Run input schema documentation can be found in the input section of the Actor details page. See [RAG Web Browser input schema](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser/input-schema).

```python
tool.invoke({"run_input": {"query": "what is apify?", "maxResults": 2}})
```

## Chaining

We can provide the created tool to an [agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/). When asked to search for information, the agent will call the Apify Actor, which will search the web, and then retrieve the search results.

```python
pip install langgraph langchain-openai
```

```python
from langchain.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_agent


model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5-mini")
tools = [tool]
graph = create_agent(model, tools=tools)
```

```python
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "search for what is Apify")]}
for s in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="values"):
    message = s["messages"][-1]
    # skip tool messages
    if isinstance(message, ToolMessage):
        continue
    message.pretty_print()
```

```text

### Instagram Scraper

```python
from langchain_apify import ApifyActorsTool

instagram_tool = ApifyActorsTool("apify/instagram-scraper")

# Scrape Instagram posts
result = instagram_tool.invoke({
    "run_input": {

        "resultsLimit": 10
    }
})
```

### Google Search Results Scraper

```python
google_search_tool = ApifyActorsTool("apify/google-search-scraper")

# Scrape Google Search results
result = google_search_tool.invoke({

## Using Apify MCP Server

Unsure which Actor to use or what parameters it requires?
The [Apify MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](https://mcp.apify.com) can help you discover available Actors, explore their input schemas, and understand parameter requirements through the Model Context Protocol.

To use the Apify MCP server with LangChain:

```python
import os
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langchain.agents import create_agent

client = MultiServerMCPClient({
    "apify": {
        "transport": "http",
        "url": "https://mcp.apify.com",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['APIFY_TOKEN']}",
        },
    }
})

tools = await client.get_tools()
agent = create_agent("gpt-5-mini", tools)
```

For more information, see the [LangChain MCP documentation](/oss/python/langchain/mcp) and [Apify MCP server](https://mcp.apify.com).
