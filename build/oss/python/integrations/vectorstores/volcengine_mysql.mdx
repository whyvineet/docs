> [Volcengine RDS for MySQL](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6313) is a fully managed, stable, and scalable relational database service developed by Volcano Engine(Volcengine). [Volcengine](https://www.volcengine.com/docs?lang=en) is a cloud service platform developed by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. This integration allows you to use RDS for MySQL as a vector store in LangChain.

## Setup

To use the Volcengine MySQL vector store, you'll need a Volcengine account and an RDS for MySQL instance.

### Installation

Install the integration package:

```bash pip
pip install -U langchain-volcengine-mysql
```
---

## Instantiation

Configure the `mysql` submodule, then access `mysql.vector_store`.

```python
from langchain_volcengine_mysql import mysql
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

mysql.configure(
    host="your-mysql-host.example.com",
    port=3306,
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_db",
    table_name="langchain_vectors",
    embedding_function=embeddings,
)

vector_store = mysql.vector_store
retriever = mysql.retriever
```

---

## Manage vector store

### Add items

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

docs = [
    Document(page_content="Volcengine RDS for MySQL is a managed relational database.", metadata={"source": "docs"}),
    Document(page_content="You can use it as a LangChain vector store.", metadata={"source": "docs"}),
]

vector_store.add_documents(documents=docs, ids=["1", "2"])
```

### Delete items

```python
vector_store.delete(ids=["2"])
```

---

## Query vector store

### Similarity search

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search(query="What is RDS for MySQL?", k=1)
for doc in results:
    print(f"* {doc.page_content} [{doc.metadata}]")
```

### Use as a retriever

```python
docs = retriever.invoke("What is RDS for MySQL?")
```
