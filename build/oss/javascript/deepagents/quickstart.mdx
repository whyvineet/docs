description: Build your first deep agent in minutes
---

This guide walks you through creating your first deep agent with planning, file system tools, and subagent capabilities. You'll build a research agent that can conduct research and write reports.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have an API key from a model provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI).

<Note>
    Deep agents require a model that supports [tool calling](/oss/javascript/concepts/tool-calling). See [customization](/oss/javascript/deepagents/customization#model) for how to configure your model.
</Note>

### Step 1: Install dependencies



<CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install deepagents langchain @langchain/core @langchain/tavily
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add deepagents langchain @langchain/core @langchain/tavily
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add deepagents langchain @langchain/core @langchain/tavily
    ```
</CodeGroup>


<Note>
    This guide uses [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) as an example search provider, but you can substitute any search API (e.g., DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI, Brave Search).
</Note>

### Step 2: Set up your API keys

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key"
```

### Step 3: Create a search tool



```typescript
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { TavilySearch } from "@langchain/tavily";
import { z } from "zod";

const internetSearch = tool(
  async ({
    query,
    maxResults = 5,
    topic = "general",
    includeRawContent = false,
  }: {
    query: string;
    maxResults?: number;
    topic?: "general" | "news" | "finance";
    includeRawContent?: boolean;
  }) => {
    const tavilySearch = new TavilySearch({
      maxResults,
      tavilyApiKey: process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY,
      includeRawContent,
      topic,
    });
    return await tavilySearch._call({ query });
  },
  {
    name: "internet_search",
    description: "Run a web search",
    schema: z.object({
      query: z.string().describe("The search query"),
      maxResults: z
        .number()
        .optional()
        .default(5)
        .describe("Maximum number of results to return"),
      topic: z
        .enum(["general", "news", "finance"])
        .optional()
        .default("general")
        .describe("Search topic category"),
      includeRawContent: z
        .boolean()
        .optional()
        .default(false)
        .describe("Whether to include raw content"),
    }),
  },
);
```


### Step 4: Create a deep agent



```typescript
import { createDeepAgent } from "deepagents";

// System prompt to steer the agent to be an expert researcher
const researchInstructions = `You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct thorough research and then write a polished report.

You have access to an internet search tool as your primary means of gathering information.

## \`internet_search\`

Use this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the max number of results to return, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.
`;

const agent = createDeepAgent({
  tools: [internetSearch],
  systemPrompt: researchInstructions,
});
```


### Step 5: Run the agent



```typescript
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is langgraph?" }],
});

// Print the agent's response
console.log(result.messages[result.messages.length - 1].content);
```


## How does it work?

Your deep agent automatically:

1. **Plans its approach** using the built-in [`write_todos`](/oss/javascript/deepagents/harness#to-do-list-tracking) tool to break down the research task.
1. **Conducts research** by calling the `internet_search` tool to gather information.
1. **Manages context** by using file system tools ([`write_file`](/oss/javascript/deepagents/harness#file-system-access), [`read_file`](/oss/javascript/deepagents/harness#file-system-access)) to offload large search results.
1. **Spawns subagents** as needed to delegate complex subtasks to specialized subagents.
1. **Synthesizes a report** to compile findings into a coherent response.

## Examples

For agents, patterns, and applications you can build with Deep Agents, see [Examples](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/tree/main/examples).

## Next steps

Now that you've built your first deep agent:

- **Customize your agent**: Learn about [customization options](/oss/javascript/deepagents/customization), including custom system prompts, tools, and subagents.
- **Understand middleware**: Dive into the [middleware architecture](/oss/javascript/deepagents/middleware) that powers deep agents.
- **Add long-term memory**: Enable [persistent memory](/oss/javascript/deepagents/long-term-memory) across conversations.
- **Deploy to production**: Learn about [deployment options](/oss/javascript/langgraph/deploy) for LangGraph applications.
