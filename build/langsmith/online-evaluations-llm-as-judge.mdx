[Online evaluations](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#online-evaluation) provide real-time feedback on your production traces. This is useful to monitor the performance of your application continuously—to identify issues, measure improvements, and ensure consistent quality over time.

**[LLM-as-a-judge](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#llm-as-judge)** evaluators use an LLM to evaluate traces as a scalable substitute for human-like judgment. This guide covers **run-level** evaluators that evaluate a single run. For evaluating entire conversation threads, see [multi-turn online evaluators](/langsmith/online-evaluations-multi-turn).

<Note>When an online evaluator runs on any run within a trace, the trace will be auto-upgraded to [extended data retention](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention-auto-upgrades). This upgrade will impact trace pricing, but ensures that traces meeting your evaluation criteria (typically those most valuable for analysis) are preserved for investigation. </Note>

## View online evaluators

In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchian.com), head to the **Tracing Projects** tab and select a tracing project. To view existing online evaluators for that project, click on the **Evaluators** tab.

## Configure online evaluators

#### 1. Navigate to online evaluators

Head to the **Tracing Projects** tab and select a tracing project. Click on **+ New** in the top right corner of the tracing project page, then click on **New Evaluator**. Select the evaluator you want to configure.

#### 2. Name your evaluator

#### 3. Create a filter

For example, you may want to apply specific evaluators based on:

- Runs where a [user left feedback](/langsmith/attach-user-feedback) indicating the response was unsatisfactory.
- Runs that invoke a specific tool call. See [filtering for tool calls](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application#example-filtering-for-tool-calls) for more information.
- Runs that match a particular piece of metadata (e.g. if you log traces with a `plan_type` and only want to run evaluations on traces from your enterprise customers). See [adding metadata to your traces](/langsmith/add-metadata-tags) for more information.

Filters on evaluators work the same way as when you're filtering traces in a project. For more information on filters, you can refer to [this guide](./filter-traces-in-application).

<Tip>
It's often helpful to inspect runs as you're creating a filter for your evaluator. With the evaluator configuration panel open, you can inspect runs and apply filters to them. Any filters you apply to the runs table will automatically be reflected in filters on your evaluator.
</Tip>

#### 4. (Optional) Configure a sampling rate

Configure a sampling rate to control the percentage of filtered runs that trigger the automation action. For example, to control costs, you may want to set a filter to only apply the evaluator to 10% of traces. In order to do this, you would set the sampling rate to 0.1.

#### 5. (Optional) Apply rule to past runs

Apply rule to past runs by toggling the **Apply to past runs** and entering a "Backfill from" date. This is only possible upon rule creation.

<Note>
The backfill is processed as a background job, so you will not see the results immediately.
</Note>

In order to track progress of the backfill, you can view logs for your evaluator by heading to the **Evaluators** tab within a tracing project and clicking the Logs button for the evaluator you created. Online evaluator logs are similar to [automation rule logs](./rules#view-logs-for-your-automations).

- Add an evaluator name.
- Optionally filter runs that you would like to apply your evaluator on or configure a sampling rate.
- Select **Apply Evaluator**.

#### 6. Configure the LLM-as-a-judge evaluator

View this guide to configure an [LLM-as-a-judge evaluator](/langsmith/llm-as-judge?mode=ui#pre-built-evaluators-1).
