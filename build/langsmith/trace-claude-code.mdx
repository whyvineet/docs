This guide shows you how to automatically send conversations from the [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) to LangSmith.

Once configured, you can opt-in to sending traces from Claude Code projects to LangSmith. Traces will include user messages, tool calls and assistant responses. As system prompts aren't returned in Claude Code's conversation transcripts, these are not included in the trace.

## How it works

1. A global "Stop" [hook](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide#get-started-with-claude-code-hooks) is configured to run each time Claude Code responds.
2. The hook reads Claude Code’s generated conversation transcripts.
3. Messages in the transcript are converted into LangSmith runs and sent to your LangSmith project.

<Note> Tracing is opt-in and is enabled per Claude Code project using environment variables. </Note>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up tracing, ensure you have:

- **Claude Code CLI** installed.
- **LangSmith API key** ([get it here](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/apikeys)).
- **Command-line tool** `jq` - JSON processor ([install guide](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/))

<Info>
This guide currently only supports macOS.

## 1. Create the hook script

`stop_hook.sh` processes Claude Code's generated conversation transcripts and sends traces to LangSmith. Create the file `~/.claude/hooks/stop_hook.sh` with the following script: [stop_hook.sh](https://github.com/langchain-ai/tracing-claude-code/blob/main/stop_hook.sh)

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/stop_hook.sh
```


## 2. Configure the global hook

Set up a global hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` that runs the `stop_hook.sh` script. The global setting enables you to easily trace any Claude Code CLI project.

In `~/.claude/settings.json`, add the `Stop` hook.

```json
{
"hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/stop_hook.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 3. Enable tracing

For each Claude Code project (a Claude Code project is a directory with Claude Code initialized) where you want tracing enabled, create or edit [Claude Code's project settings file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#:~:text=Project%20settings%20are%20saved%20in%20your%20project%20directory%3A) `.claude/settings.local.json` to include the following environment variables:

- `TRACE_TO_LANGSMITH: "true"` - Enables tracing for this project. Remove or set to `false` to disable tracing.
- `CC_LANGSMITH_API_KEY` - Your LangSmith API key
- `CC_LANGSMITH_PROJECT` - The LangSmith project name where traces are sent
- (optional) `CC_LANGSMITH_DEBUG: "true"` - Enables detailed debug logging. Remove or set to `false` to disable tracing.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "TRACE_TO_LANGSMITH": "true",
    "CC_LANGSMITH_API_KEY": "lsv2_pt_...",
    "CC_LANGSMITH_PROJECT": "project-name",
    "CC_LANGSMITH_DEBUG": "true"

  }
}
```

<Note> Alternatively, to enable tracing to LangSmith for all Claude Code sessions, you can add the above JSON to your [global Claude Code settings.json](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#:~:text=User%20settings%20are%20defined%20in%20~/.claude/settings.json%20and%20apply%20to%20all%20projects.) file. </Note>

## 4. Verify setup

Start a Claude Code session in your configured project. Traces will appear in LangSmith after Claude Code responds.

In LangSmith, you'll see:

- Each message to Claude Code appears as a trace.
- All turns from the same Claude Code session are grouped using a shared `thread_id` and can be viewed in the **Threads** tab of a project.


## Troubleshooting

### No traces appearing in LangSmith

1. **Check the hook is running**:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.claude/state/hook.log
   ```
   You should see log entries after each Claude response.

2. **Verify environment variables**:
   - Check that `TRACE_TO_LANGSMITH="true"` in your project's `.claude/settings.local.json`
   - Verify your API key is correct (starts with `lsv2_pt_`)
   - Ensure the project name exists in LangSmith

3. **Enable debug mode** to see detailed API activity:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "CC_LANGSMITH_DEBUG": "true"
     }
   }
   ```
   Then check logs for API calls and HTTP status codes.

### Permission errors

Make sure the hook script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/stop_hook.sh
```

### Required commands not found

Verify all required commands are installed:

```bash
which jq curl uuidgen
```

If `jq` is missing:
- **macOS**: `brew install jq`
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install jq`

### Managing log file size

The hook logs all activity to `~/.claude/state/hook.log`. With debug mode enabled, this file can grow large:

```bash
# View log file size
ls -lh ~/.claude/state/hook.log

# Clear logs if needed
> ~/.claude/state/hook.log
```
