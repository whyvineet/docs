title: Agent visibility
description: Understand the differences between private and workspace agents in Agent Builder.
---

Agent Builder supports two visibility modes for agents:

- **Private agents**: Private to the creator. Useful for personal workflows and experiments.
- **Workspace agents**: Shared within the workspace. Good for team workflows or for agents you want to share with others.

## Differences

| Feature | Private agents | Workspace agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ownership and access** | Only visible to you | Visible to anyone within the same LangSmith workspace |
| **OAuth authentication** | OAuth credentials are scoped to you | OAuth credentials are scoped to each user; new users cloning workspace agents must re-authenticate with selected tools |
| **Secrets** | Uses workspace-scoped LangSmith secrets | Uses workspace-scoped LangSmith secrets (same as private agents) |

## Workspace-scoped agent details

While workspace-scoped agents are shared, some details are public, while others are private.

### Threads/chat history

Threads are always user-scoped, so even if an agent is workspace-scoped, the chat history created within that agent will always be private and only accessible to the specific user who created them.

### System prompt, tools, sub-agents

The system prompt, selected tools, and sub-agents will be public on workspace-scoped agents. Users will not be able to modify these fields on the original workspace-scoped agent, but can make changes once they've cloned the agent.

### Triggers

The trigger type on workspace-scoped agents is public (for example, Slack message received), but the specific connection with the trigger (for example, the Slack channel, or Gmail address) is not shared. This way, users know what trigger to use when cloning an agent, but can't gain unauthorized access to any connections the original user has set up.
