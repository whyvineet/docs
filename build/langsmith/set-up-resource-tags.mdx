Resource tags are available for Plus and Enterprise plans.

While workspaces help separate trust boundaries and access control, tags help you organize resources within a workspace. Tags are key-value pairs that you can attach to resources.

<Note>
**Not to be confused with commit tags**: Resource tags are key-value pairs used to organize and filter workspace resources (projects, datasets, prompts, etc.). [Commit tags](/langsmith/manage-prompts#commit-tags) are labels that reference specific versions in a prompt's commit history. While both types of tags can use similar terminology (like `prod` or `staging`), resource tags help you *organize resources* across your workspace, while commit tags control *which version* of a prompt is used in your code.
</Note>

## Create a tag

To create a tag, head to the workspace settings and click on the "Resource Tags" tab. Here, you'll be able to see the existing tag values, grouped by key. Two keys `Application` and `Environment` are created by default; the `Application` key is used to filter resources shown in the UI.

To create a new tag, click on the "New Tag" button. You'll be prompted to enter a key and a value for the tag. Note that you can use an existing key or create a new one.

## Assign a tag to a resource

Within the same side panel for creating a new tag, you can also create assign resources to tags. Search for corresponding resources in the "Assign Resources" section and select the resources you want to tag.

<Note>
You can only tag workspace-scoped resources with resource tags. This includes Tracing Projects, Annotation Queues, Deployments, Experiments, Datasets, and Prompts.
</Note>

To un-assign a tag from a resource, click on the Trash icon next to the tag, both in the tag panel and the resource tag panel.

## Delete a tag

You can delete either a key or a value of a tag from the [workspace settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/workspaces/resource_tags). To delete a key, click on the Trash icon next to the key. To delete a value, click on the Trash icon next to the value.

Note that if you delete a key, all values associated with that key will also be deleted. When you delete a value, you will lose all associations between that value and resources.
