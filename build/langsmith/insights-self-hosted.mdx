[Insights](/langsmith/insights) provides AI-powered analysis of your traces and application data within LangSmith. This page explains how to enable Insights on a [self-hosted LangSmith instance](/langsmith/self-hosted).

<Info>
Self-hosted LangSmith is an add-on to the Enterprise plan. For more details, refer to [Pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing). [Contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.

## Components

Insights consists of two main components:

- `agentBootstrap`: Job that deploys the LangSmith Deployment (agent) needed for Insights.
- `insightsAgent`: The main agent that will handle insights generation.

## Enable Insights

To enable Insights, add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
backend:
  agentBootstrap:
    enabled: true

config:
  insights:
    enabled: true
    encryptionKey: "<your-encryption-key>"
```

### Generate an encryption key

Insights requires a Fernet encryption key to securely store secrets. Generate one using Python:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

<Note>
You can store the encryption key in a predefined Kubernetes secret using the `insights_encryption_key` parameter. See [Use an existing secret](/langsmith/self-host-using-an-existing-secret#parameters) for details.
