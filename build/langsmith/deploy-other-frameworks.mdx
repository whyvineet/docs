This guide shows you how to use [Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api) to deploy a [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/) on [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) and set up tracing for [LangSmith Observability](/langsmith/observability). You can follow the same approach with other frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK.

Using Functional API and deploying to LangSmith Deployment provides several benefits:

* Production deployment: Deploy your integrated solution to [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) for scalable production use.
* Enhanced features: With Functional API, you can integrate your existing agents with [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [streaming](/langsmith/streaming), [short and long-term memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) and more, with minimal changes to your existing code.
* Multi-agent systems: Build [multi-agent systems](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) where individual agents are built with different frameworks.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Dependencies: `pip install strands-agents strands-agents-tools langgraph`
* AWS Credentials in your environment

## 1. Define strands agent

Create a Strands Agent with pre-built tools.

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import file_read, file_write, python_repl, shell, journal

agent = Agent(
        tools=[file_read, file_write, python_repl, shell, journal],
        system_prompt="You are an Expert Software Developer Assistant specializing in web frameworks. Your task is to analyze project structures and identify mappings.",
        model="us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0",
    )
```

## 2. Use Functional API to deploy on LangSmith Deployment

[Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api) allows you to integrate and deploy with frameworks other than LangChain. Functional API also provides the additional benefit to leverage other key features — persistence, memory, human-in-the-loop, and streaming — coupled with your existing agent, with minimal changes to your existing code.

It uses two key building blocks:

* **[`@entrypoint`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint)**: Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.
* **[`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task)**: Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.

```python
from strands.types.content import Message

from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
import operator

@task
def invoke_strands(messages: list[Message]):
    # run the agent with existing messages; can invoke with the final message with messages[-1]
    result = agent(messages)
    # return the resulting message
    return [result.message]

@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages: list[Message], previous: list[Message]):
    messages = operator.add(previous or [], messages)
    response = invoke_strands(messages).result()
    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=operator.add(messages, response))
```

## 3. Set up tracing with OpenTelemetry

In your environment variables, set up the following:

```python
# Turn off LangSmith default tracing, as we want to only trace with OpenTelemetry
LANGSMITH_TRACING=false

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://api.smith.langchain.com/otel/"

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = "x-api-key=your-langsmith-api-key,Langsmith-Project=your-tracing-project-name"
```

<Note>
If you're [self-hosting LangSmith](/langsmith/self-hosted), replace the  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` endpoint with your LangSmith API endpoint and append `/api/v1/otel`. For example: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://ai-company.com/api/v1/otel"`
</Note>

<Note>
Strand's OTel tracing contains synchronous code. In this case, you may need to set `BG_JOB_ISOLATED_LOOPS=true` to execute background runs in an isolated event loop separate from the serving API event loop.
</Note>

In your main agent, set up the following:

```python
from strands.telemetry import StrandsTelemetry

strands_telemetry = StrandsTelemetry()
strands_telemetry.setup_otlp_exporter()
strands_telemetry.setup_meter()
```

## 4. Prepare for deployment

From here, to deploy to LangSmith, create a file structure like the following:

```
my-strands-agent/
├── agent.py          # Your main agent code
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── langgraph.json   # LangGraph configuration
```

To deploy your agent, follow the [Deploy to cloud](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud) guide.
