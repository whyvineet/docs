description: Agent Builder's core features
---

Agent Builder essentials are the core features that make up the foundation of your agents. They include tools, triggers, memory, sub-agents, and approvals.

## Tools

Tools let your agents interact with your apps and services. Your agents can send emails, create calendar events, post messages, search the web, and more. Choose from built-in tools for Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, GitHub, and many others.

See [Supported tools](/langsmith/agent-builder-tools) for a complete list.

## Triggers

Triggers define when your agent should start running. You can connect your agent to external tools or time-based schedules, letting it respond automatically to messages, emails, or recurring events.

Here are some popular ways to trigger your agent:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack">
    Activate your agent when messages are received in specific Slack channels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gmail" icon="envelope">
    Trigger your agent when emails are received.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cron schedules" icon="clock">
    Run your agent on a time-based schedule for recurring tasks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Skills

Skills are a way to bundle capabilities and provide more specific information in situations where the context is not universally relevant.

Using skills can help:

- Save on token usage by only providing the context that is relevant to the current task.
- Prevent the agent from having too much context in the system prompt, which can lead to hallucinations and incorrect responses.

For more information, see [Skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills).

## Memory and updates

Agents remember important information from previous conversations and can update themselves to work better.

- Memory: Agents remember relevant details from past interactions, so they can make better decisions in future conversations.
- Self-updates: Agents can add new tools, remove ones they don't need, or adjust their instructions to improve how they work.
- What stays the same: Agents can't change their name, description, or the triggers that start them.

For more information, see [How we built Agent Builder's memory system](https://www.langchain.com/conceptual-guides/how-we-built-agent-builders-memory).

## Custom models

Agent Builder supports custom models. You can connect any LLM API that supports the **OpenAI chat completions spec** or **Anthropic chat spec**.

Common use cases include:

- **LLM proxies**: Route requests through services like LiteLLM, Portkey, or your own proxy.
- **Self-hosted models**:Connect to models running on your own infrastructure.
- **Alternative providers**: Use any provider with a compatible API.

To add a custom model:

1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the agent you want to edit.
1. Click on the <Icon icon="gear" /> settings icon in the top right corner.
1. In the **Model** section, select **+ Add custom model**.
1. Enter the model ID, display name, base URL, and API key name and value.
1. Click **Save**.

<Note>
  Custom models must be accessible through a public API endpoint. LangSmith cannot connect to models hosted on private networks, behind VPNs, or on machines that are not exposed to the internet.
</Note>

## Sub-agents

Build complex agents by breaking big tasks into smaller, specialized helpers. Think of sub-agents as a team of specialists—each one handles a specific part of the job while working together with your main agent.

This approach makes it easier to build sophisticated systems. Instead of one agent trying to do everything, you can have specialized helpers that each excel at their part of the task.

Here are some ways you might use sub-agents:

- Split into sub-tasks: Have one agent fetch data, another summarize it, and a third format the results.
- Specialized tools: Give different agents access to different tools based on what they need to do.
- Independent work: Let sub-agents work on their own, then bring their results back to the main agent.

## Human-in-the-loop

Stay in control of important decisions. You can set up your agent to pause and ask for your approval before taking certain actions. This ensures your agent handles most tasks automatically, while you retain oversight.

### Setting up approval steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a tool">
    When setting up your agent, choose the tool or action you want to review before it runs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Turn on approval">
    Find the approval option for that tool and switch it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent waits for you">
    When your agent reaches that step, it will pause and wait for your approval before continuing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What you can do when your agent pauses

When your agent stops to ask for approval, you have three options:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Accept" icon="check">
    Give the green light and let your agent proceed with its plan.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit" icon="pen-to-square">
    Modify the agent's message or parameters before allowing it to continue.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send feedback" icon="comment">
    Share feedback to help your agent learn and improve.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Traces

Traces are a series of steps that your agent takes to go from input to output. You can use [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) to visualize these execution steps:

1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to your agent's inbox.
1. Right-click on the thread you want to trace and select **View trace**.

For more information, see [LangSmith Observability](/langsmith/observability).
