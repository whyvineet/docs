Works just like the GenericLoader but concurrently for those who choose to optimize their workflow.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import ConcurrentLoader
```

```python
loader = ConcurrentLoader.from_filesystem("example_data/", glob="**/*.txt")
```

```python
files = loader.load()
```

```python
len(files)
```

```text
2
```

```python

```
