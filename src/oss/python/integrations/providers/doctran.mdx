>[Doctran](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran) is a python package. It uses LLMs and open-source
> NLP libraries to transform raw text into clean, structured, information-dense documents
> that are optimized for vector space retrieval. You can think of `Doctran` as a black box where
> messy strings go in and nice, clean, labelled strings come out.
